<p>In 1997 a uniquely wholesome brand of water was born. After testing a natural water source buried in the heart of KwaZulu-Natal and finding it was too good not to share, the water was bottled and branded “aQuellé”. aQuellé is a hybrid of the Latin word ‘aqua’, meaning water and the German word ‘Quelle’ meaning spring.

aQuellé then introduced typically South African flavours in 1998 and we have seen our flavoured drinks range grow as it now offers 9 refreshing flavours. It’s no wonder then that aQuellé is loved by all South Africans today! </p>
