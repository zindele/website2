     <p>In 1997 a uniquely wholesome brand of water was born.
      After testing a natural water source buried in the heart of KwaZulu-Natal

      and finding it was too good not to share, the water was bottled and branded aQuelle.
     aQuelle is a hybrid of the Latin word aqua, meaning water and the German word Quelle meaning spring.</p>

     <p>aQuelle then introduced typically South African flavours in 1998 and we have seen our flavoured drinks range grow a
     s it now offers 9 refreshing flavours. It's no wonder then that aQuelle is loved by all South Africans today! </p>

     <h1>Our bottling plant</h1>
     <p>The aQuelle bottling plant, which has grown from a mere 360 square meters in 1998 to over
     14 000 square meters to date, is tucked away in the heart of Kwa-Zulu Natal,
      where aQuelle's exceptionally pure natural spring water flows under the earth's surface.
       In 2016, aQuelle acquired a secondary plant in Franschhoek which supplies the Western Cape area,
        reducing aQuelle's carbon footprint significantly. As with the main bottling plant,
        the Franschhoek natural spring water is of exceptional quality and taste.

     In the bottling plant, the unique, customized bottles are blown in-line.
      The water is flavoured and carbonated, and then bottled in a completely sterile environment.
       The plant is equipped with the latest filling technology and state-of-the art machinery and processes.
       All to make sure that when you enjoy your aQuelle you have a genuinely good experience.

     After being labeled and shrink-wrapped,
     the product is palletized and ready for distribution to all aQuelle's eager customers!</p>
     <h1>Packaging</h1>
     <h2>The 3 aQuelle product ranges are each uniquely packaged to fit your lifestyle!</h2>

    <p> The natural spring water packaging has a classy feel and a few functional benefits.
      It sports a flat base for better stability,
      a flip-top for the 750 ml bottle,
       which makes it easier to open and more hygienic as well as a comfortable handle for the economic 5L bottle.

     The flavoured sparkling drinks range bottle has a distinctive shape with a trendy wave design and slim easy-grip waist,
      which is perfect for the active consumer who is on the move.</p>
